#Before making classes, we initialize constants that we will use throughout the program
# since each other file will load this one, all the files will have access to these 
# These constants may need to be updated, and should periodically be checked for accuracy
# These constants currently are, in order:
#   AcceptableAlphanumerics
#   Alphabet
#   BalyMaxNum

# This is the root file of the Baly Project Code, and is loaded into every more complex file. 
# Thus any functions or methods added should be fully included here and not loaded into more complex files.
# The full file dependency is as follows:
# balyClasses => prettyCommonFunctions => indexConverter => kmlParser => indexOps => autoMethods
#
# It should be noted that classificationData.rb is only a data store that is automatically loaded by indexConverter
